<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>

<P>This documentation describes version 0.91 of the EPICS nslsdet record, and
related EPICS software required to build and use it.  This version of the
record is compatible with EPICS 3.14.7, and is incompatible with any earlier
version of EPICS. It has only been built and tested on a Linux platform for use
in an RTEMS application running on a Motorola Coldfire CPU. The software
occupies a complete application TOP directory, and expects the apropriate
cross-compilers and cross utilities to be installed, and a working RTEMS
installation to be in place.

<P>The nslsdet record resides within the embedded IOC which controls the NSLS
High Energy Resolution Multi-Element Silicon detector (HERMES-X). This IOC is
tightly coupled with the specific hardware for this detector, and is based on a
credit-card sized computer which employs a Motorola Coldfire 32-bit
microprocessor, which has ethernet and serial ports, on-chip timers, digital I/O
bits, and an industry-standard SPI port to which are attached D/A and A/D
converters, controlled by auxiliary standard ao and ai records in the IOC
database. 

<P>HERMES consists of 32 * N identical channels, where N is an integer specific
to the particular implementation in use (in this case, 20), each containing a
complete solid-state detector processing chain. Each chain consists of a
low-noise charge-sensitive preamplifier, variable-gain shaping amplifier (0.75
or 1.5V / fC) with selectable shaping time (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microseconds), a
set of 5 pulse-height discriminators arranged as one simple threshold and two
window-discriminators or single-channel analysers (SCA's) and three 24-bit
counters, one each for the threshold and two SCA's. A built-in time base
generator provides counter gating intervals in 1ms increments.

<P>The Nslsdet record provides support for a bank of three sets of 32 x N
24-bit counters controlled by a common start/stop mechanism, all contained
within HERMES. All counters are simple up-counters. When the counters
overflow, they saturate at the maximum possible 24-bit value (16,777,215).

<P>The count time interval is provided by one of the Coldfire processor's
on-chip counters. It counts down from the programmed value using a clock derived
from the CPU system clock, having a period of 1ms. The fields 
<UL>
<LI>TP (time preset)
<LI>PR1 (scaler channel 1 preset value), and
<LI>FREQ (clock frequency)
</UL> satisfy the following equation:
<PRE>
	TP = PR1 / FREQ
</PRE>
FREQ defaults to 1000, and should not be changed by the user.

<P>This is how the nslsdet record is intended to be used:
<OL>
<LI>The user sets TP (time preset)
<LI>The user sets CNT to "Count" (1), initiating counting.
<LI>The counters count until TP has expired, whereupon
   the record resets CNT to "Done" (0), or the user manually resets CNT to
   "Done" (0), causing counting to stop.
</OL>

<P>This version of the nslsdet record maintains two counting modes: normal and
background (also called AutoCount).  Normal counting is controlled by the CNT
("Count/Done") field, the time preset, and other presets, as described above. 
Background counting is controlled by the CONT ("OneShot/AutoCount") field,
normally ignores user preset values, and is intended to give the user
continuous updates whenever the scaler would otherwise be idle. This device
differs from the standard scaler record in that the hardware cannot be read on
the fly, so the scaler values are only updated at the end of the count period
(normal or background).

<P>When CONT = "AutoCount" (1), and no normal counting operation is already in
progress, the scaler waits for the AutoCount delay (DLY1); counts for the
AutoCount period (TP1); and displays the result.  If the AutoCount period (TP1)
is less than .001 s, we default to the normal criteria for determining the count
period. Background counting is interrupted immediately whenever a normal
counting operation is started with the CNT field, and the results of a normal
counting operation are held for a defined time (default 3 seconds) after the
scaler finishes that operation before background counting begins again. The hold
time can be changed from the Coldfire console by modifying an EPICS variable
(nslsdet_wait_time). Background counting never affects the state of the CNT
field, so this field can always be used to determine when a normal counting
operation has begun and finished.

<P>The nslsdet record is unlike most other EPICS records in that its
processing is neither "synchronous" nor "asynchronous", as these terms
are used in the EPICS Record Reference Manual.  Currently, the PACT
field is always FALSE after record processing has completed, even
though the scaler may be counting.  This means the record always
responds to channel-access puts, and that counting can be stopped at
any time.  The record's forward link is not executed until the scaler
has stopped counting.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>CNT	<TD>R/W*	<TD>Count	<TD>RECCHOICE <TD>(0:"Done", 1:"Count")
	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
User sets this field to "Count" (1) to start counting.  When a preset is reached,
counting will stop, this field will be reset to "Done" (0), and the forward
link will be fired.  If this field is set to "Done" (0) while counting is in
progress, counting will be stopped, the accumulated counts will be reported,
and the forward link will be fired.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>CONT	<TD>R/W*	<TD>OneShot/AutoCount	<TD>RECCHOICE
<TD>(0:"OneShot", 1:"AutoCount") <TR><TD COLSPAN=5> User sets this field to

gate signal, and the GATE connector is an input. Currently, the  functionality
for G1=1 is not implemented, and its assigned value is ignored and assumed 0.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>S1...S3	<TD>R	<TD>Scaler n value (EGU)		<TD>LONG

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5>
	
The counts accumulated by the scalers. They are (32 x N)-element arrays, 
corresponding to the 3 counters in each channel. These are posted 
once after counting stops, either normal or background.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>VAL	<TD>R	<TD>Sum of equivalent scalers (EGU)		<TD>LONG

	<TR><TD COLSPAN=5> The sum of all Sn channels, i.e. the total counts
