To make hardware timer:

put small value in reference counter, enough to be sure interrupt service
routine is run before next compare.
Set output low, and enable toggle on compare
enable interrupt & start timer

on interrupt: check for output low. 
	If not, load time value into compare
		register and re-enable interrupt, 
		then return
	if so, disable interrupt
		return
